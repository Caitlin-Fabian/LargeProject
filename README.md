# UCFGO
UCFGO is an exploration based game made for freshman and anyone new to the UCF campus. The game works by displaying a map of campus and tracking 
the gps of the user. When the User gets near a POI (Point Of Interest) they will be able to catch a monster. The monsters descriptions are related
to UCF to help familiarize the user with UCFâ€™s geography and culture. There are 11 monsters hidden across campus that can be found by either self 
exploration or using our Journey page on the web app.
